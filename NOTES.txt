WEB INTEGRATION PHASE 1
-----------------------
1. Update Android web view sample with home screen changes
   
2. Intercept web view load errors on Android in the same way as iOS?
   The goal is a more controlled display
   
3. Think a bit more about displaying stack trace in debug v release builds
   Same info should be available in PROD but not rendered

WEB INTEGRATION NEXT
-----------------------
1. Rename samples from mobilewebview to mobileweb
   Update deep linking assets files and OAuth trust entries

2. Get basics of opening with system browser working
   This will require an SPA login which is expected

3. Develop small Security API for one time tokens as its own repo
   This will be a small Serverless API that uses DynamoDB and can be tested in isolation
   
4. Integrate mobile / web samples to use Security API

GENERAL BUGS
------------
1. Bookmark SPA page on iPad  - no state in storage

2. Deep link to company 4 on iPad when company 2 active - no refresh
   Occurs in main sample - see workaround code
   
3. Concurrent Home clicks should not run code twice for webview apps
   
4. Remove tokens on uninstall but not on upgrades
   Test reinstall after login with stored tokens - should prompt to login again
