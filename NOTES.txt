WEB INTEGRATION STAGE 1
-----------------------
1. Get rid of mobile page loading from my 3 APIs

2. Understand WKWebView operations better
   Errors not reported when web content cannot load, eg SPA host not running
   Use ConsoleErrorReporter to report error
   May need navigation actions to handle:

3. Return stack trace in serialized error, which requires more serialization work
   Improve Web UI error display to be multi line in the mobile case
   Remains single line in the SPA case to enable copying of bundle stack traces

4. Rename samples + namespaces to webintegration
   Security API will be a different repo

5. Bookmark SPA page on iPad  - no state in storage

6. Deep link to company 4 on iPad when company 2 active - no refresh
   Occurs in main sample - see workaround code

WEB INTEGRATION STAGE 2
-----------------------
1. Mobile Splash / Home screen (iOS and Android)
   Loading message
   Error Summary Display
   Retry button
   Later will show options to Load SPA:
   * Web View
   * External web content

2. Concurrent Home clicks should not run code twice

3. Remove tokens on uninstall but not on upgrades
   Test uninstall after login
