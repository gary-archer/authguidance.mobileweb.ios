WEB INTEGRATION PHASE 1
-----------------------
1. Update Android web view sample with home screen changes
   
2. Intercept web view errors on Android in the same way as iOS?

WEB INTEGRATION NEXT
-----------------------
1. Rename to mobileweb

2. Get open without passing token working

3. Develop small Security API for one time tokens as its own repo
   This will be a small Serverless API that uses DynamoDB and can be tested in isolation
   
4. Integrate mobile / web samples to use Security API

GENERAL BUGS
------------
1. Bookmark SPA page on iPad  - no state in storage

2. Deep link to company 4 on iPad when company 2 active - no refresh
   Occurs in main sample - see workaround code
   
3. Concurrent Home clicks should not run code twice for webview apps
   
4. Remove tokens on uninstall but not on upgrades
   Test reinstall after login with stored tokens - should prompt to login again
