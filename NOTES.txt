WEB INTEGRATION
---------------
1. Render extended error info
   Use an orientation handler to improve text about SPA and error displays
   Retry when there is a config load error - do print output to prove it
   Put back isInitialised and retry during SPA invocation clicks

2. Get rid of ErrorConsoleReporter if possible?
   Test logout request errors

3. Update main iOS sample with extended error info
   Update device installs of both apps

4. Update Android web view sample with home screen changes
   Update device installs opf mobile web app

5. Return stack trace in serialized error, which requires more serialization work
   Improve Web UI error display to be multi line in the mobile case
   Remains single line in the SPA case to enable copying of bundle stack traces

WEB INTEGRATION STAGE 2
-----------------------
1. Rename to mobileweb
   Security API for one time tokens will be a different repo

2. Concurrent Home clicks should not run code twice

3. Remove tokens on uninstall but not on upgrades
   Test uninstall after login

GENERAL BUGS
------------
1. Bookmark SPA page on iPad  - no state in storage

2. Deep link to company 4 on iPad when company 2 active - no refresh
   Occurs in main sample - see workaround code
