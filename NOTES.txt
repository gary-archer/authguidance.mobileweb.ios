WEB INTEGRATION
---------------
1. Show a 'Mobile Web Integration Demo' title
   It can update to Problem Encountered + Retry when needed
   Show options to Load SPA:
   * Web View
   * External web content

2. Test rendering of errors containing domain + code + user info
   Update main sample to show this data
   Get rid of ErrorConsoleReporter if possible?

3. Return stack trace in serialized error, which requires more serialization work
   Improve Web UI error display to be multi line in the mobile case
   Remains single line in the SPA case to enable copying of bundle stack traces

WEB INTEGRATION STAGE 2
-----------------------
1. Rename to mobileweb
   Security API for one time tokens will be a different repo

2. Concurrent Home clicks should not run code twice

3. Remove tokens on uninstall but not on upgrades
   Test uninstall after login

GENERAL BUGS
------------
1. Bookmark SPA page on iPad  - no state in storage

2. Deep link to company 4 on iPad when company 2 active - no refresh
   Occurs in main sample - see workaround code
