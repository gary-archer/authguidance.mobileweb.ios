1. Outgoing login redirect problem
   Seems to be ReactJS binding related
   Company / User Info views get recreated when Continue is clicked in ASWebAuthenticationSession window
   Could be because when I set location.hash to #/loggedout it does not seem to stick
   React app.tsx render method is called again and isLoggedIn gets called

2. Get custom https scheme logins working and response received
   Add entitlements and update mobile assets file

3. Complete all OAuth behaviour

4. Understand WKWebView operations better
   Errors not reported when web content cannot load
   Reproduce when running web content locally with no running host
   Use ConsoleErrorReporter to report error
   May need navigation actions to handle:

5. Use same launch icon as Android

6. Splash screen for startup - indicates 'Loading ...' by default
   Also has a Reload button and displays an error summary link
   Also will enable the SPA to start as external web content later
   Do the same for Android

7. Return stack trace in serialized error, which requires more serialization work
   Improve Web UI error display to be multi line in the mobile case
   Remains single line in the SPA case to enable copying of bundle stack traces

8. Concurrent Home clicks should not run code twice

9. Get rid of mobile page loading from my 3 APIs

10. Remove tokens on uninstall but not on upgrades
