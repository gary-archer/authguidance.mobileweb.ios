WEB INTEGRATION NEXT
-----------------------
1. Rename samples from mobilewebview to mobileweb
   Update deep linking assets files and OAuth trust entries

2. Get basics of opening with system browser working
   This will require an SPA redirect which is expected

3. SSO should be automatic
   Explain use of one time tokens
   Consider implementing it but maybe just write about it instead
   Can anyone with a valid token access UI operations, possibly with different privileges?
   
4. Think a bit more about displaying stack trace in debug v release builds
   Same info should be available in PROD but not rendered

GENERAL BUGS
------------
1. Bookmark SPA page on iPad  - no state in storage

2. Deep link to company 4 on iPad when company 2 active - no refresh
   Occurs in main sample - see workaround code
   
3. Concurrent Home clicks should not run code twice for webview apps
   
4. Remove tokens on uninstall but not on upgrades
   Test reinstall after login with stored tokens - should prompt to login again
