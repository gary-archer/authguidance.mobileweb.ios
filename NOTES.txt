0. Outgoing login redirect problem
   Company / User Info views get recreated when Continue is clicked in ASWebAuthenticationSession window

1. Get custom https scheme logins working and response received
   Add entitlements and update mobile assets file

2. Understand WKWebView operations better
   Errors not reported when web content cannot load
   Reproduce when running web content locally with no running host
   Use ConsoleErrorReporter to report error
   May need navigation actions to handle:

3. Use same launch icon as Android

4. Splash screen for startup - indicates 'Loading ...' by default
   Also has a Reload button and displays an error summary link
   Also will enable the SPA to start as external web content later
   Same UI for Android

5. Return stack trace in serialized error, which requires more serialization work
   Improve Web UI error display to be multi line in the mobile case
   Remains single line in the SPA case to enable copying of bundle stack traces

6. Concurrent Home clicks should not run code twice

7. Get rid of mobile page loading from my 3 APIs

8. Remove tokens on uninstall but not on upgrades
